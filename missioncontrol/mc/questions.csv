What kind of samples do you think the real Mars robot takes for analysis?|Photos. Gas. Soil. Rock. This photo is a view of the third and fourth trenches made by the 4cm scoop on NASA's Mars rover curiosity in October 2012.|Question1.jpg
Why does it sometimes take longer for information from Mars robots to reach Mission Control on Earth?|Both Earth & Mars have elliptical orbits, so are not always the same distance apart.|Question2.jpg
Approximately how many photos are combined to make the panoramas we currently have of the Martian landscape?|As few as 400 images and as many as 900. The panorama below is a combination of 817 photos taken by the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity.|Question3.jpg
Suggest an advantage of taking multiple samples as the robot travels.|It increases efficiency, allowing the terrain to be mapped more rapidly and avoids missing valuable data. This photo shows data from the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer instrument on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity, showing an unusual enrichment of silicon in 'Wildrose' and 'Bonanza King' rocks.|Question4.jpg
How do you think scientists use the data collected to identify areas for further exploration?|They will look at patterns and distribution of variables measured and compare them with earlier data or other locations and related them to their initial hypothesis. This picture shows a view on Mars from the curiosity rover.|Question5.jpg
Please tell us one thing you liked about the day, one way we could we make it better and one thing you learnt.|Thanks! We'll use your answers to improve the workshop for other students.|
