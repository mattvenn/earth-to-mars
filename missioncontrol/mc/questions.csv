What kind of samples do you think the real Mars robot takes for analysis?|Photos. Gas. Soil. Rock.|
Why does it sometimes take longer for information from Mars robots to reach Mission Control on Earth?|Both Earth & Mars have elliptical orbits, so are not always the same distance apart.|
No question|No answer|
Do you think the Mars robot sends back an averaged value, or each individual piece of data?|It sends individual data, as to send an averaged value would cause detail to be lost, such as of potentially interesting anomalies.|
Suggest an advantage of taking multiple samples as the robot travels.|It increases efficiency, allowing the terrain to be mapped more rapidly and avoids missing valuable data.|
How do you think scientists use the data collected to identify areas for further exploration?|They will look at patterns and distribution of variables measured and compare them with earlier data or other locations and related them to their initial hypothesis.|
