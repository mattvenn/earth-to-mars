What kind of samples do you think the real Mars robot takes for analysis?|Photos. Gas. Soil. Rock.|
Why does it sometimes take longer for information from Mars robots to reach Mission Control on Earth?|Both Earth & Mars have elliptical orbits, so are not always the same distance apart.|
Approximately how many photos are combined to make the panoramas we currently have of the Martian landscape?|As few as 400 images and as many as 900. The panorama below is a combination of 817 photos taken by the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity.|
Suggest an advantage of taking multiple samples as the robot travels.|It increases efficiency, allowing the terrain to be mapped more rapidly and avoids missing valuable data.|
How do you think scientists use the data collected to identify areas for further exploration?|They will look at patterns and distribution of variables measured and compare them with earlier data or other locations and related them to their initial hypothesis.|
Please tell us one thing you liked about the day, one way we could we make it better and one thing you learnt.|Thanks!|
